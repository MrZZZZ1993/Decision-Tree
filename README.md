# Decision-Tree
Implement a decision tree with some basic libraries, such as numpy 

dTree.py is the main file.
calculate_score.py contains all functions used to justify the best attribute. For example, entropy, information gain, gain ratio, gini
process_data.py contains all functions used to deal with data. For example, converting continuous data into discrete data

mldata.py and test_mldata.py are files I found online to read files with special format
